# My First Arcade Game
## Getting Started
You can view the game here: https://angelocandari.github.io/fed-arcade-game/

## Introduction
This is a game made from javascript. _Freddy_, the frog, needs to cross the street to get to the pond where he lives. He needs to avoid being crushed by the bugs. As an extra point, he can get stars along the way to get more scores.

## Game Mechanics
- Use the _Up, Left, Down, Right_ arrow to move _Freddy_.
- _Freddy_ gets 100 points each time he reaches the pond.
- _Stars_ will get him an extra 40 points everytime he collects one.
- Getting hit by a _bug_ will cost him 20 points and returns him to his original position.
- If _Freddy_ get's reaches the pond, the game resets and _Freddy_ returns to his original position to do it all over again.

## Code Structure
- Sprite is the Class common to all objects on the canvas.
- Enemy is the Class for the bugs.
- Player is the Class for the _Freddy_.
- Star is the Class for the Power Ups.
- There is a Score Class that holds the score of the player.
- Make sure to download all files to run the game without a hitch.

Have Fun!
